## How Does The Internet Work?
Files, photos, and websites are all stored in a computer(also known as a server). Similar to how different destinations in the real world can have people, businesses, or just be a storage facility.

The internet is like a highway- a mode of transit helping you move to and from one destination to another.

When you are going to a website, you are using the internet (highway) to reach a destination (server).

## What is the difference between backend and frontend?
### **Backend**
The **Backend** is like the kitchen in a restaurant where all the work happens. Usually, the work being done is hidden from the customer/end-user. It is where information is stored, organized, and manipulated.
### **Frontend**
Utilizing the same analogy, **Frontend** is is like the dining area of a restaurant. The entire area and atmosphere are tailored for a specific experience for the customer/end-user. The frontend is necessary for the end-user to be able to access what they're trying to get from the backend.
