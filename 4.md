# What is Big O Notation?
Big O Notation is a mathmatical way to show how efficient an algorithm is.


# Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta.
## Big O Notation
Big O Notation evaluates efficiency based off the worse case performance (the most amount of time required).

## Big Omega Notation
Big Omega Notation is very similar to Big O Notation, but evaluates efficiency based off the best case performance (the least amount of time required).

## Big Theta Notation 
Big Theta Notation uses the best of worst case performance to evaluate performance
