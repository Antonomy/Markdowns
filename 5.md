Node.js is not a programming language - it is a JavaScript runtime that was built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Unlike Chrome, which restricts your ability to use Javascript only in the DOM, Node.js provides access system resources, memory, file systems, etc.
❓ Is Express a programming language? What is Express?
No, Express is not a programming language. It is a Node.js framework used to build APIs, web applications, and cross-platform mobile apps.
❓ What is the primary reason why Node/Express applications are so performant?
Node/Express applications are performant because Node.js is asynchronous and single-threaded. This means, that because the I/O operations don't block each other, you can do execute multiple tasks all at the same time.

❓ Describe the MVC Diagram that we have been using in class?
The MVC Diagram explains the entire lifecycle of how requests are processed in a Node.js/Express environment.
1. A visitor makes a request
2. The Node.js main server takes the request and references the required resources for the application
3. Utilizing Express and the routeController, it determines if changes are being made to the database or the view(HTML).
4a. If a changing or reading data is necessary, Express utilizes Mongoose to do so in mongoDB.
4b. If a change in view is dictated by the routeController, Express will request the HTML template
5. Express will ultimately send all the information back to the visitor that made the request to the application.
