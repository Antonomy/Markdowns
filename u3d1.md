React applications are made up of components that you nest into other components. They can only return one JSX tag and all items in a list need to have a unique key so that they can be manipulated and tracked. When using event handlers, you don't use partentheses and call it yourself, but you pass it down and allow React to call the event handler. WHen two components need to pass data to each other, you need to move the variable upwards and then pass down the variable to each component - this is also known as props.
